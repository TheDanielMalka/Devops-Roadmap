18/02/2026

Issue #52: Docker Concepts & Architecture (COMPLETED)
- Problem Docker solves: "works on my machine" - packages app + dependencies in one container
- Container vs VM: Container shares host Kernel (lightweight, MBs, seconds to start) vs VM runs full OS (heavy, GBs, minutes)
- Docker Engine 3 parts:
  - Client: CLI commands in terminal (docker run, docker ps)
  - Daemon (dockerd): runs in background, does all the work (pull, run, manage)
  - Registry (Docker Hub): online storage for ready-made images (nginx, python, postgres)
- Flow: You type command → Client sends to Daemon → Daemon checks locally → pulls from Registry if missing → runs container
- Docker Desktop: installs Client + Daemon + GUI together, uses WSL2 for Daemon
- Image = blueprint (read-only template), Container = running instance (can run multiple from same image)
- Installed Docker on WSL2, verified with docker run hello-world

Infra:
- Closed Sprint 2 (100%, 28/28 issues, 26 SP)
- Created Sprint 2 Report (Word doc)
- Setup Sprint 3: Milestone + 10 Issues + Labels (Docker: Images/Volumes/Networking/Compose/Registry/Dockerfile)
- Setup Jira Sprint 3: SCRUM-32 to SCRUM-41
- Fixed sync-tasks pagination (per_page=100)
- Project Arena: Closed PA-6 (Jira & GitHub Integration)


19/02/2026


Issue #53: Running & Inspecting Containers (COMPLETED)
- docker run: pulls image if missing, creates and starts container
- Detached mode (-d): runs container in background, frees terminal
- docker ps: shows running containers. ps -a shows all including stopped
- docker logs: view container output, first thing to check when debugging
- docker exec -it <name> bash: enter container shell, temporary access for debugging
- docker stop: graceful shutdown. docker start: restart stopped container
- docker rm: delete stopped container. rm -f: force stop + delete
- --rm flag: auto-delete container when it stops
- Port mapping (-p 8080:80): maps host port to container port, required for external access
- Multiple containers can use same internal port, each gets unique host port
- docker inspect: full container details (state, network, config, ports)
- Container isolation: closed by default, -p opens specific ports to outside
