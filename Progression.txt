27/01/2026 

- Built a custom Logging Middleware to track server requests.✅
- Built an API endpoint (/infrastructure) that returns data in JSON format. ✅
- Added a basic security check using a key in the URL (?admin=true). ✅
- Created an automated script to check if the .env file exists before the server starts. ✅
- Linked scripts together so the server won't run if the setup is missing. ✅

-Progression Update: Sprint 1 Closure & Infrastructure Prep
✅ Sprint 1 Review Completed: Conducted a comprehensive summary marathon. Demonstrated full proficiency in Git Flow, Express Middlewares, and GitHub Actions (Final Score: 97%).

🛠️ Work Infrastructure Ready: דrepared the environment for the next sprint across all platforms:

GitHub: Configured professional Labels (Security, Infrastructure, Automation, CI/CD) and initialized the Sprint 2 Milestone.

Jira: Alignment completed for the official Sprint 2 launch on Sunday.

System Foundation: Defined core Linux & OS pillars (Shell, Permissions, Virtualization, SSH) as the baseline for upcoming tasks.

🚀 Ready for Sprint 2: All systems synchronized. Development kick-off scheduled for Sunday morning.
