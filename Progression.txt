18/02/2026

Issue #52: Docker Concepts & Architecture (COMPLETED)
- Problem Docker solves: "works on my machine" - packages app + dependencies in one container
- Container vs VM: Container shares host Kernel (lightweight, MBs, seconds to start) vs VM runs full OS (heavy, GBs, minutes)
- Docker Engine 3 parts:
  - Client: CLI commands in terminal (docker run, docker ps)
  - Daemon (dockerd): runs in background, does all the work (pull, run, manage)
  - Registry (Docker Hub): online storage for ready-made images (nginx, python, postgres)
- Flow: You type command → Client sends to Daemon → Daemon checks locally → pulls from Registry if missing → runs container
- Docker Desktop: installs Client + Daemon + GUI together, uses WSL2 for Daemon
- Image = blueprint (read-only template), Container = running instance (can run multiple from same image)
- Installed Docker on WSL2, verified with docker run hello-world

Infra:
- Closed Sprint 2 (100%, 28/28 issues, 26 SP)
- Created Sprint 2 Report (Word doc)
- Setup Sprint 3: Milestone + 10 Issues + Labels (Docker: Images/Volumes/Networking/Compose/Registry/Dockerfile)
- Setup Jira Sprint 3: SCRUM-32 to SCRUM-41
- Fixed sync-tasks pagination (per_page=100)
- Project Arena: Closed PA-6 (Jira & GitHub Integration)


19/02/2026


Issue #53: Running & Inspecting Containers (COMPLETED)
- docker run: pulls image if missing, creates and starts container
- Detached mode (-d): runs container in background, frees terminal
- docker ps: shows running containers. ps -a shows all including stopped
- docker logs: view container output, first thing to check when debugging
- docker exec -it <name> bash: enter container shell, temporary access for debugging
- docker stop: graceful shutdown. docker start: restart stopped container
- docker rm: delete stopped container. rm -f: force stop + delete
- --rm flag: auto-delete container when it stops
- Port mapping (-p 8080:80): maps host port to container port, required for external access
- Multiple containers can use same internal port, each gets unique host port
- docker inspect: full container details (state, network, config, ports)
- Container isolation: closed by default, -p opens specific ports to outside


Issue #54: Docker Images (COMPLETED)
- Image = read-only blueprint, Container = running instance. One image can create many containers
- docker images (list), docker pull (download), docker rmi (delete). rmi has 'i' to distinguish from rm (containers)
- Tags: always use specific version in production, latest can change and break things
- Layers & Caching: images share layers to save space, pull skips download if image exists locally

Issue #55: Docker Networking (COMPLETED) - Understand Docker default networks (bridge, host, none) - docker 
network ls / create: list networks and create custom bridge network - Connect containers to same network and 
verify isolation - Container DNS resolution: verified that containers resolve each other by name - Practical: 
ping (L3 connectivity) vs curl (L7 application response) - Documented findings in 
SPRINT3/docker-networking-notes.md

2nd Docker Sprint Week. moving on to Docker Volumes 

Issue #56: Docker Volumes & Data Persistence (COMPLETED)
- Containers lose all data when removed - proved by creating file, deleting container, new container = gone
- Named Volume: Docker manages folder, portable (same command works everywhere), data survives container deletion
- Bind Mount: maps host folder to container, syncs both ways in real time, good for dev but not portable (path must exist)
- tmpfs: stored in RAM only, deleted when container stops, for temporary/sensitive data
- Difference: Named Volume = Docker manages, Bind Mount = you manage. Both persist data, only portability differs
- Practical: Postgres with pgdata volume, created table + inserted data, deleted container, new container = data survived
- Volume is local only - other machines start with empty volume, not meant for sharing data between machines

Issue #57: Writing Dockerfiles (COMPLETED)
- Dockerfile = recipe for building custom image, line by line instructions
- FROM: base image (python:3.11-slim). Always use specific version not latest
- WORKDIR: sets working directory inside image, creates if not exists
- COPY: copies files from project folder into image. Only sees files in Dockerfile's directory
- Two COPYs pattern: copy requirements first, install, then copy code - saves rebuild time with caching
- RUN: executes commands during build (pip install, mkdir). Each RUN = new layer. Combine with &&
- ENV: sets environment variables baked into image. Like -e flag but permanent
- EXPOSE: documentation only, does not open port. -p flag actually opens ports
- CMD: default command when container starts, can be overridden. ENTRYPOINT: fixed, cannot override
- docker build -t <name> . builds image. -t names image, dot = current directory
- -t = name for image (build), --name = name for container (run)
- Dockerized TaskManager: built image, ran container, added volume for data persistence
- .dockerignore works like .gitignore - excludes files from image Opus 4.6

23/02/2026

Issue #58: Docker Compose (COMPLETED)
- Compose = one YAML file replaces multiple manual docker run commands, one command starts everything
- docker-compose.yml structure: services (containers), volumes, networks. Compose auto-creates network for all services
- docker compose up -d (start all), down (stop + remove containers/network, keeps volumes), ps (status), logs (output)
- depends_on: controls startup order (db before app). env_file: loads variables from .env file (passwords not exposed in compose)

Issue #59: Docker Registry & Repository (COMPLETED)
- Docker Hub = public registry for images, like GitHub for code. Used it every docker pull
- docker login: authenticate to Docker Hub. docker tag: name image as user/repo:tag format
- docker push: upload image to registry. docker pull: download from registry (also from own repos)
- Private registries exist (AWS ECR, GCP GCR, GitHub GHCR) - same commands, different address. Used in production for security

24/02/2026

- Enabled MFA on both root and admin accounts
- Created read-only user, tested permission limits on EC2 launch - blocked as expected


Issue #83: AWS VPC - Networking Fundamentals (COMPLETED)
- VPC = private virtual network in the cloud
- CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 defines address space (65,536 addresses)
- Public subnet: servers with external IP, internet accessible
- Private subnet: no external IP, internal only
- Internet Gateway: translates internal to external addresses, connects VPC to internet
- Route Tables: direct traffic - public subnet routes to IGW, private stays internal
- Security Groups: firewall per server, blocks all inbound by default
- NACLs: firewall per subnet, stateless (doesn't remember connections)
- Practical: Created custom "arena-vpc" with public + private subnet, IGW, route tables

Issue #84: AWS EC2 (COMPLETED)
