Advanced Repository Restructuring - Organized code into /test and /scripts for professional scalability ✅
CI/CD Path Alignment - Updated GitHub Actions (YAML) to support new directory structure ✅


* Established a professional Node.js environment with NPM and custom automation scripts. ✔
* Integrated ESLint v9 (Flat Config) for static code analysis and syntax enforcement. ✔
* Configured Nodemon for real-time hot-reloading and automated development cycles. ✔
* Synchronized LeetCode with GitHub via LeetHub and initialized Jira for roadmap management. ✔
* Developed a custom Bash-based utility for automated daily progress logging. ✔

Microservices Foundation – Initialized a standalone Node.js Express server within the Monorepo structure. ✅

Configuration Management (.env) – Implemented environment variables using dotenv to separate secrets/configs from source code. ✅

Dev Productivity Automation – Configured Nodemon with custom NPM scripts for automated development lifecycles. ✅

LeetCode Automation Sync – Integrated LeetHub to automate the synchronization of daily algorithmic challenges with GitHub. ✅

Repository Refactoring – Restructured the main Repo into a professional "Monorepo" layout with a centralized .gitignore and global README. ✅

- Built a custom Logging Middleware to track server requests.✅
- Built an API endpoint (/infrastructure) that returns data in JSON format. ✅
- Added a basic security check using a key in the URL (?admin=true). ✅
- Created an automated script to check if the .env file exists before the server starts. ✅
- Linked scripts together so the server won't run if the setup is missing. ✅

-Progression Update: Sprint 1 Closure & Infrastructure Prep
✅ Sprint 1 Review Completed: Conducted a comprehensive summary marathon. Demonstrated full proficiency in Git Flow, Express Middlewares, and GitHub Actions (Final Score: 97%).

🛠️ Work Infrastructure Ready: Prepared the environment for the next sprint across all platforms:

GitHub: Configured professional Labels (Security, Infrastructure, Automation, CI/CD) and initialized the Sprint 2 Milestone.

Jira: Alignment completed for the official Sprint 2 launch on Sunday.

System Foundation: Defined core Linux & OS pillars (Shell, Permissions, Virtualization, SSH) as the baseline for upcoming tasks.

🚀 Ready for Sprint 2: All systems synchronized. Development kick-off scheduled for Sunday morning.

=== SCRUM-20: Basic Concepts of Operating Systems ===

OS Architecture: Kernel manages hardware with full access, User Space runs applications with limited permissions, System Calls bridge between them.

Process Creation: fork() duplicates parent process, exec() replaces child code with new program. Every process born from another (except PID 1 created by Kernel at boot).

Process States: R (running), S (sleeping - interruptible), D (sleeping - uninterruptible, stuck on I/O), T (stopped by signal), Z (zombie - finished but parent didn't read exit status).

Memory Management: Virtual Memory gives each process isolated address space. Kernel translates virtual to physical addresses. Memory divided into Pages (4KB blocks). When RAM full, inactive pages moved to Swap (disk). Heavy Swap usage = performance problem.

System Calls & Interrupts: System Call = application requests service from Kernel (user-initiated). Interrupt = hardware notifies Kernel that event occurred (hardware-initiated). Both are bridges between different layers of the system.

Assessment: 82% overall (78% background check, 100% new material)
