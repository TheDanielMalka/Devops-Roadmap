# 🚀 DevOps Roadmap - Zero to Production Engineer

Welcome to my unique DevOps journey. Unlike traditional learning, this repository documents a **"Build While You Learn"** methodology. I am building a complete, enterprise-grade DevOps ecosystem from scratch, implementing every concept as I master it.

## 🧠 The Concept: Learning by Engineering
I treat my learning process as a professional project. This repository isn't just for code; it's a live demonstration of infrastructure setup, task management, and automation.
* **From 0 to Hero:** Every tool is configured manually to understand the "under the hood" mechanics.
* **Agile Learning:** Managed via Jira with full GitHub integration.
* **Professional Standards:** Implementing CI/CD, Linting, and Testing from day one.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Ecosystem Integration
* **Project Management:** [Jira](https://the-daniel-malka.atlassian.net/) (Scrum methodology)
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions (Automated Test & Lint)
* **Environment & Config:** NPM & Python
* **Source Control:** Git (Trunk-based workflow)

## 📈 Progression Tracking
I maintain full transparency of my growth:
* **[Daily Progression Log](./Progression.txt):** What I implemented today.
