Git Flow uses multiple 
long-lived branches (main, 
develop, feature, release, 
hotfix) with structured 
branching. Trunk-Based 
maintains a single main 
branch with small, frequent 
commits. Git Flow suits 
scheduled releases and 
larger teams. Trunk-Based 
enables faster deployment 
and continuous delivery 
but requires strong testing 
automation.
