# Virtualization Concepts

## Hypervisors
A Hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs).

### Type 1: Bare Metal
- **Definition:** Runs directly on the host's hardware.
- **Examples:** VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen.
- **Efficiency:** High, as there is no middle-man OS.
- **Use Case:** Enterprise data centers and cloud providers (AWS, Azure).

### Type 2: Hosted
- **Definition:** Runs as an application on top of an existing Operating System.
- **Examples:** VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox.
- **Use Case:** Personal development, testing different OSs on a PC.
